Vinyl Collector is a cataloguing application for collectors of vinyl records

The application has been re-written in Python using PyQt5 for the GUI and tinyDB for file based non-SQL database management

***The user can now:***

Add any vinyl release with the following fields:

- Artist
- Title
- Label
- Catalogue Number
- Genre
- Format
- Country
- Year of Release

Delete a record by clicking on the record in the table and then pressing the delete button

Edit a record and then re-save to the database

***Issues / still to-do:***

Add more fields

Aesthetic changes and improvements to the GUI

Add sorting functionailty to the app table

Possibly add API integration so that users can lookup information about a record. This functionailty is available through one of my other projects 'Record Data Finder' but I may integrate the two.
