Vinyl Collector is a cataloguing application for collectors of vinyl records

The application has been re-written in Python using PyQt5 for the GUI and tinyDB for file based non-SQL database management

***The user can now:***

Add any vinyl release with the following fields:

- Artist
- Title
- Label
- Catalogue Number
- Genre
- Format
- Country
 - Year of Release

 Delete a record

***Issues / still to-do:***

Add more fields

Aesthetic changes and improvements to the GUI

Possibly add API integration so that users can lookup information about a record. This functionailty is available through one of my other projects 'Record Data Finder' but I may integrate the two.

Testing
